    <h2 id="drainage"> <br><br><br><br> Drainage Systems and Orders </h2>
    <p>
      <mark>Angular</mark>: where bedrock joints and faults intersect at more acute angles than rectangular drainage patterns. Can be acute or obtuse<br>
      <mark>Annular</mark>: known as the ‚Äúcircular pattern‚Äù. Streams traces out the weak belt of rock leading to the formation of tangential or greater concentric path. ex: red valley that encircles domal structure of Black Hills (South Dakota) <br>
      <mark>Barbed</mark>: originated when tributaries flowed in an opposite direction to the master stream. When tributaries flow in the opposite direction to their master streams. Caused by stream piracy (river capture). Forms obtuse angle with main-stream (points up) Ex: Maumee river, fort wayne <br>
      <mark>Basin</mark>: depression, or dip, in the Earth's surface; bowl shaped <br>
      <mark>Centripetal</mark>: converges at a point. Ex: arid areas, parts of cali or new mexico, or in karst or deranged areas of drainage <br> 
      <mark>Classical order</mark>: "Bottom up" order. Mouth of river is 1 <br>
      <mark>Dendritic</mark>: forms on rock not folded (such as granite). Minimal faulting and jointing. One type of rock/ area has a similar resistance to erosion. Most common. Arborescent. Canadian Shield, areas of British Columbia. Widespread in North America plains, Badlands south dakota <br>
      <mark>Deranged</mark>: A drainage system in drainage basins where there is no coherent pattern to the rivers and lakes.Ex: Canadian shield, Siberian tundra landscapes <br>
      <mark>Divide</mark>: elevated terrain that separates neighboring drainage basins. <br>
      <mark>Endorheic basin</mark>: closed basin; retains water. Water converges to single point in basin (a sink).  <br>
      <mark>Integrated</mark>: unique to arid climates. They form by the coming together of individual basins formerly separated by high ground <br>
      <mark>Herringbone</mark>: develops in mountain-containing regions with steep slopes/valleys, where tributaries and master streams converge. tributaries meet at right angles to the stream. Lateral consequents: the tributaries, Longitudinal consequent: main stream <br>
      <mark>Horton</mark>: used by GIS services. Top down. Tributaries are 1
Major stream divide: water on sides never meet till ocean <br>
      <mark>Major river orders</mark>: Amazon :12th, Mississippi: 10th, Rio grande: 7th <br>
      <mark>Minor stream divide</mark>: waters meet at confluence  <br>
      <mark>Parallel</mark>: forms where there‚Äôs steep slope (mountain ranges). more frequent in newly emerged coastal plains.  Ex:  mesa verde national park in CO, other regions of plateaus with monoclinal warps <br>
      <mark>Pinnate</mark>: leaf pattern. Feather-like, with tributaries parallel and joining the master stream at acute angles.  <br>
      <mark>Radial</mark>: when there‚Äôs peaks like volcanoes . mt rainier, lake district of England, avery dome <br>
      <mark>Rectangular</mark>: faulting and no topography. Tightly packed rocky ground, ex: adirondack mountains. Streams follow the path of least resistance and thus are concentrated in places where exposed rock is the weakest. Movement of the surface due to faulting off-sets the direction of the stream. As a result, the tributary streams make sharp bends and enter the main stream at high angles. Least common: Canada <br>
      <mark>Shreve</mark>: sums the number of sources in each catchment above a stream gauge or outflow, and correlates roughly to the discharge volumes and pollution levels.  <br>
      <mark>Strahler</mark>: Horton Strahler. When two streams with different orders join, the resulting stream has the same order as the highest order of the two joining streams.   <br>
      <mark>Trellis</mark>: bedrock eroded in different magnitudes of strength. alternating bands of weak and resistant bedrock. -Hard and soft rocks run parallel to each other. Ex: Appalachian mountains, Rocky Mts and Alberta. Synclines: downturned folds which form valleys in which reside the main channel of the stream. Anticlines: Short tributary streams that enter the main channel at sharp angles as they run down sides of parallel ridges <br>

      <mark>Baygall</mark>: type of bog found in forest of Gulf Coast states. covered in heath or heather shrubs rooted in sphagnum moss and peat <br>
      <mark>Blanket bog</mark>: blanket mire, featherbed bog. forming where there is a climate of high rainfall and a low level of evapotranspiration, allowing peat to develop not only in wet hollows but over large expanses of undulating ground. <br>
      <mark>Bogs</mark>: muskegs. In cool, northern climates. Lowest pH (acidic). Has acidic water; most water received from precipitation. The rainwater that bogs receive are mineral Poor. Spongy peat deposits. Peat due to low oxygen in soil. Low in nutrients. Low in Dissolved Oxygen (DO) because bogs are saturated with water which doesn't flow in and out of them easily. Low levels of oxygen and make it more difficult for fungi and bacteria to decompose dead plants quickly, leading to peat formation.  Forms: 1. as sphagnum moss grows over a lake or pond and slowly fills it (terrestrialization), 2. form as sphagnum moss blankets dry land and prevents water from leaving the surface (paludification). hard clay soil that prevents water from seeping out. Evergreen shrubs and cranberries found. Protects Water filtration, flood prevention, habitat protection. <br>
      <mark>Cataract bog</mark>: rare ecological community formed where a permanent stream flows over a granite outcropping. Ecosystems that feature permanent freshwater stream <br>
      <mark>Fens</mark>: peat forming. Less acidic due to frequent water flow. Steady source from groundwater. The mineral-rich groundwater in fens acts as a pH buffer. Woody vegetation. Sedges. Peat accumulating. Lower latitude than bogs. More nutrients than bogs. Supports larger diversity of plants than bogs. Waterlogged soil that is peaty, fed by upwelling water, not productive. Rich fens are less acidic than poor fens. Poor fens have higher species richness than bogs. Above rocks rich in calcium <br>
      <mark>Fens ‚Üí Bogs transition</mark>: transitions as peat accumulates, groundwater input can be reduced or cut off  <br>
      <mark>Halophytes</mark>: live in salt marshes. <br>
      <mark>Mallines</mark>: wetland and meadow in argentina. Where water table is at surface but mallin is still area of net infiltration<br>
      <mark>Mangroves</mark>:  tropical plants that are adapted to loose, wet soils, salt water and being periodically submerged by tides. Categorized as swamps. Intertidal zone. Diversity greatest in South East Asia <br>
      <mark>Marshes</mark>: fed by groundwater. herbaceous plants (grass, reed, sedges). Treeless. Types: tidal salt marshes, tidal freshwater marshes (common in U.S.), and inland freshwater marshes. Vegetation: Papyrus Sedge
Peat: turf, is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter. Mire, Quagmire, Muskeg <br>
      <mark>Peat bogs</mark>: carbon sinks. stores carbon in process called sequestration. 200 bil tons globally <br>
      <mark>Pocosins</mark>: ‚Äúswamp on a hill‚Äù. Evergreen tree/shrub and tree dominated. Rain provides most of their water. Ombrotrophic environments
Prairie potholes: depressional wetlands. <br>
      <mark>Quaking bog</mark>: area of ‚Äúshoogly ground‚Äù usually found on wet moorlands or near ponds and marshes. They form where an area of water is slowly covered as a mat of vegetation grows over the surface. This commonly happens on peat bogs. <br>
      <mark>Raised bog</mark>: ombrotrophic bogs. Acidic. wet habitats that are poor in mineral salts and are home to flora and fauna that can cope with such extreme conditions. unlike fens, are exclusively fed by precipitation and from mineral salts introduced. Vaguely doe shaped as decaying vegetation accumulates in center. <br>
      <mark>Salinas</mark>: man modified habitats. Salt pans. primarily found in coastal areas.   <br>
      <mark>Salt marsh</mark>: Formation by sand/silt deposited from rivers/ streams. Shelter from waves. <br>
      <mark>Seep</mark>: or flush. Moist/wet place where water, usually groundwater, reaches the earth's surface from an underground aquifer. Found near the ends of glacial moraines <br>
      <mark>Swamps</mark>: water comes from variety. Forested (ex: mangrove forest). Dominated by trees. Types: shrub swamps and forested swamps. Nutrient rich.  <br>
      <mark>Turf</mark>: peat <br>
      <mark>Valley bog</mark>: A mire community that develops in wet valley bottoms, valleys with some downstream impedance, or badly drained hollows. 
Vernal pools: seasonal depressional wetlands. sometimes connected to each other by small drainages known as vernal swales. They may be completely dry for most of the summer and fall. Valuable to local ecosystems. <br>
      <mark>Wetlands</mark>: place in which the land is covered by water (salt, fresh, or somewhere in between) either seasonally/permanently. 1) at least periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes; 2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil; and 3) the substrate is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of each year. A flat area with a shallow water table and low permeability is favorable. Improve water quality: removes pollutants from surface waters. sediment trapping, nutrient removal, chemical detoxification  Vegetation here provides habitat and food. Classified: Riverine (rivers) Lacustrine (lake) Palustrine (isolated)  <br>
      <mark>Wetting front</mark>: boundary between the upper wet part of the soil and the dry lower part
